A Poorly Written PoC demonstrating how Messenger Apps can change User IDs while still being able to communicate seamlessly with others

The Purpose of this PoC is to demonstrate the below possibilities one can have in a Messenger app:
1. You can change the server/Broker configurations anytime and easily by either opening a file or scanning a QR Code.
2. Your app can periodically change your userID while still maintaining contact with other users in your contacts
3. You can share your Contacts using QR Codes, "Whatsapp already has this"
4. The PKI infrastructure and shared secrets in sharing contacts is the way to go. 
5. People like me can write bad code. Durr!!!
